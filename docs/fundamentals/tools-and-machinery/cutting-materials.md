### General Machine Safety Tips

- Always use proper PPE (personal protective equipment) when operating machines, PPE includes:
  - Safety glasses for eye protection, should be worn during any shop procedure
  - Hearing protection in the form of ear plugs or safety ear muffs
  - Hair ties if you have long hair

- Have appropriate attire:
  - Safety glasses worn whenever in the shop
  - Durable close toed shoes
  - Long pants are preferred
  - Long sleeves rolled up when operating tools
  - Hoodie drawstrings tucked in or removed
  - Jewelry that could get caught in a machine removed (watches, rings, bracelets)
  - No gloves when operating these machines

- Adopt a Safety Mindset
  - Ask if something feels safe, what could go wrong, can it be done safer?
  - What do your surroundings look like, are others prepared for you to operate your machine
  - Look for improper use of tools, trip hazards and unprotected sharp objects

:::danger
These are only tips, **this is not comprehensive or adequate safety training**. The machine operation sections will also provide general safety tips but will not be comprehensive for safe operation. Safety for the machine in your shop may differ from what is provided. Always read a machine's manual for safe operations, especially if nobody in the room has machine shop experience.

### General Tips (condense)

- Lets say you have a piece of 2x1 box tube that will make 3 parts, with 10" leftover. It is much better to mark the part for one cut, do that cut and then repeat as opposed to marking everything at once then cutting. Doing this will account for the cutting device's thickness (known as kerf) in addition to inaccuracy in the measurement and cutting process. 
- When making cuts it is best to be aware of the side you are keeping. Generally it is not good practice to cut on the line you have marked, unless that line was marked with the kerf of the tool in mind. Instead cut more towards the side that will not be your current part. The amount to offset your cut by will depend heavily on what you are cutting with.
- Think about how mistakes in precision will work out. If making two parts that are identical think about the severity of different mistakes. Can both parts be undersized, can one part be oversized while the other is undersized. It can be better to have two identical parts that are similarly wrong than one part that is correct with the other part being significantly off. 
- It is best to have the person who measures the part making the cuts. 
- Always make sure to clean up your parts.

### Chop Saw

A great tool for rectangular wood, hex shaft and tube stock. When purchasing a machine we recommend staying clear of abrasive cut off saws, make sure that your machine is made to be able to cut metal.

<br />

Start making sure the chop saw is in a safe state, it is ideal to have the saw unplugged while setting up. When safe, put your work in the saw, some saws may have built in work holding while others will require the usage of a clamp. Typically 2 bar clamps will suffice for machines without built in work holding. Loosely align the cutting line with the blade then snug the work holding device against the part without preventing it from moving.

<br />

From here move the blade closer to the part for a better alignment. Make sure not touch the blade to the part during this phase. Think about how the part was marked, and attempt to position the end of the blade a tad bit further away from the edge of keep location, making sure to be on the non-part side. When positioned correctly clamp the part down, making sure it doesn&#39;t move the part out of alignment.

<br />

Put on hearing protection, ensure people around you are aware the machine is about to be operated and verify that your attire is proper, making extra sure you have nothing dangling. With one hand on the handle, power the saw on, wait for it to fully spin up then slowly move the blade through the stock. Do not attempt to catch the part if it will fall. Once the saw is all the way through release the power, waiting for the blade to come to a full stop before retracting. Power off the saw and retrieve your work, be wary of the area that was cut, it could be hot and/or sharp. Clean up the part.


### Vertical Bandsaw/ Tabletop Jigsaw

Good for cutting most stock, some machines may prevent longer pieces of stock from being cut in one go. Round materials may be hazardous.

:::tip
Many vertical bandsaws/tabletop jigsaws are made for cutting wood. Make sure that your machine is able to cut aluminum. Tabletop jigsaws will typically come with a blade designed for metals if they are able to cut it. Vertical bandsaws for wood run at a higher RPM than recommended for aluminum. If you have nothing else they can be used, hopefully with a blade made for cutting metals. This will dull blades quickly, may not be good for the machine and will likely be less safe.
:::

Start by making sure the machine is not plugged in or safely powered off. Generally we will make straight cuts. If the desired piece of stock does not stick over the end of the machine&#39;s table it could be useful to use something to make straight cuts. Some tables may have a device installed while others may require some creativity. 

<br/>

For machines that do not have something preinstalled grab two bar clamps, a speed square and something rectangular like tube stock or 2x4 wood. Lightly clamp the rectangular object to the table and line it up such that it gives the desired cut length on the bandsaw. Once in position use the speed square to ensure that both the front and back are square to the table then clamp down.
<br/>
(I need someone else to get images for this)
<br/>

Afterwards, configure the blade guard height such that it will barely clear the material, a good height is ~3/8&quot; over.

<br/>
(I need someone else to get images for this)
<br/>

Whenever possible use a push block or push stick. A push block could be a simple piece of wood that is tall enough to push the part effectively and wide/long enough to ensure safe distance between your fingers and the blade. A push stick is good when cuts must be very close to the blade. Generally fingers should be at least 5 inches away from the blade.

<br/>

<br/>

When preparing to cut, mime the action of cutting the material. Think about what can go wrong. Will a finger slip, where will my fingers be at the end of the cut, is there adequate distance between my fingers and the blade. If a cut feels unsafe, it is unsafe. If a cut feels unsafe try to find a safe way to make the cut with a push stick or block. If you cannot or do not want to find a safer configuration, please use a different machine or the hacksaw.

<br/>
(I need someone else to get images for this)
<br/>

Before starting, ensure people around you are aware the machine is about to be operated and verify that your attire is proper, making extra sure you have nothing dangling. Get the machine ready to start and turn on the power. Wait for the machine to reach max speed then slowly feed the material into the machine. Make progress until the part has been cut or you are unable to continue cutting. Power off the machine and wait for the blade to come to a full stop. Do not attempt to catch any part that is cut loose while the machine is on. When handling the part beware that it may be hot and sharp, especially at the area of the cut.

### Horizontal Bandsaw

Great for cutting hex shaft, box tube and circular stock.


Start by loosely aligning the cutting mark with the blade then snug the vise up to the part without tightening it. Start by lowering the blade close to the part making sure that the blade does not touch the part. Some machines are gravity fed, while others use hydraulics. If your machine uses hydraulics lock machine in place such that your blade is close to the part while still having some comfortable room. If your machine is gravity fed then it may be useful to have a friend hold the blade above the part if it cannot lock in a position. With the blade close to the part, align the blade with the cut mark, making sure to leave a bit of room for the width of the blade.

<br/>
(I need someone else to get images for this)
<br/>

When ready, tighten the vise, making sure the part does not move. Before operation, ensure people around you are aware the machine is about to be operated and verify that your attire is proper, making extra sure you have nothing dangling. Additionally assess the state of the machine and ensure it is in proper operating condition.
<br/>
(I need someone else to get images for this)
<br/>

In the case of a hydraulic horizontal bandsaw, lift the blade to be around two to three inches above the part, start the blade and let it descend at a slow speed. In the case of a gravity feed machine, turn the machine on and use the handle to lower the frame. Make sure that the blade is fully up to speed before contact with the material. For gravity feed machines you may apply a very light amount of downward force but the goal is to let the teeth do most of the work. When reaching the bottom some machines will automatically shut off while others will require you to turn them off. Wait for the machine to cut fully through the part and wait for the blade to stop after it has been turned off.

<br/>

<br/>

When retrieving your work be careful of heat and sharp edges around the cut area.


## Hacksaw

A hacksaw can be used to cut almost anything for your robot at the cost of time and potentially less precision.

<br/>

To start, make sure that your part is firmly clamped in a vice. Make sure to position the location of your cut outside of the jaws but not too far away, typically 1-4 inches away will be good, the closer the better. 

<br/>

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}><div style={{overflow: 'hidden', display: 'inline-block', margin: '0.00px 0.00px'}}><span style={{overflow: 'hidden', display: 'inline-block', margin: '0.00px 0.00px', border: '0.00px solid #000000', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)',  width: '426.00px', height: '220.23px'}}><Image autoLoad={"true"} img={require("/static/media/mechanical/cutting/image_4.jpg")} style={{ width: '624.00px', height: '351.32px', marginLeft: '-40.00px', marginTop: '-25.77px', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)', maxWidth: "none"}}></Image></span></div></div>

To get a straighter cut use a measuring device, to ensure the bottom of the stock is the same height on the left and right of the vise. A speed square works well for this.
<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}><div style={{overflow: 'hidden', display: 'inline-block', margin: '0.00px 0.00px'}}><span style={{overflow: 'hidden', display: 'inline-block', margin: '0.00px 0.00px', border: '0.00px solid #000000', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)',  width: '446.00px', height: '276.00px'}}><Image autoLoad={"true"} img={require("/static/media/mechanical/cutting/image_5.jpg")} style={{ width: '624.00px', height: '351.00px', marginLeft: '0.00px', marginTop: '-51.00px', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)', maxWidth: "none"}}></Image></span></div></div>

<br/>
When you are ready to begin your cut, double check that your hacksaw blade is tensioned correctly. The blade should be tight with little side to side wiggle but make sure not to over tighten the blade. In the pictured hacksaw&rsquo;s case the tightening device is just above the handle.
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

Cuts cannot be undone, a hacksaw can wander if proper attention is not given. We do not want to cut on the line, we want to cut on the non-keep side. Cutting on the scribed line will result in our part being undersized.

<p><br /> </p>

<div style={{overflow: 'hidden', display: 'inline-block', margin: '0.00px 0.00px'}}><span style={{overflow: 'hidden', display: 'inline-block', margin: '0.00px 0.00px', border: '0.00px solid #000000', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)',  width: '588.50px', height: '515.23px'}}><Image autoLoad={"true"} img={require("/static/media/mechanical/cutting/image_7.png")} style={{ width: '1086.46px', height: '515.23px', marginLeft: '-497.96px', marginTop: '0.00px', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)', maxWidth: "none"}}></Image></span></div>

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}>Keep side in gray, blue is the stock side. Red shows the saw blade intersecting off the scribe line. Do not do this, instead line the edge of the blade with the non-keep edge of scribe mark then add a small amount of room for cutting error.</div>

<p><br /> </p>

:::note

The example images show cutting on the line for visual clarity to show a decent cut.

:::

<p><br /> </p>

The start is the most important part of the cut. Make sure that your blade is perpendicular to the part. For parts that are rectangular, start your cut at an edge instead of a face. In general when starting find an area like this for the least resistance to create a grove. Make sure to keep the blade as steady up and down as possible, if the cut line is not straight up and down it will be hard to correct later on. Angle the blade ~20 degrees with the edge and attempt to make a grove. It could be useful to use a piece of wood on one side as a guide to make sure the blade does not walk.

<p><br /> <br /> </p>

<p><br /> </p>

Once the grove has been started, keep the blade straight and use long strokes. When cutting through tube stock, the ceiling and floor walls are easiest at an angle but generally the tool should be parallel with the floor. Let the blades do most of the work, use light pressure at most for the straightest cut. When cutting, think about the two axes that need to be kept straight, the bar at the top can be rotated such that it is left or right of the blade. The handle could also not be straight with the end of the blade relative to the part.

<p><br /> </p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Top bar is rotated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handle is rotated

If you notice that you have deviated from your desired line then you may be able to bias the hacksaw such that it cuts straight again but that shift may cause some binding. If done correctly you can get a relatively straight line. When the part is hanging on by a small tab supporting it may be annoying to file, you can support the part and finish the cut. BEWARE it may be hot and the sawed edges may be sharp.

## Cleaning Up The Part

<p><br /> </p>

After the part is cut it may not be flat and it will have burrs that need to be removed.

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}><div style={{overflow: 'hidden', display: 'inline-block', margin: '0.00px 0.00px'}}><span style={{overflow: 'hidden', display: 'inline-block', margin: '0.00px 0.00px', border: '0.00px solid #000000', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)',  width: '540.00px', height: '289.00px'}}><Image autoLoad={"true"} img={require("/static/media/mechanical/cutting/image_14.jpg")} style={{ width: '624.00px', height: '1108.00px', marginLeft: '0.00px', marginTop: '-442.00px', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)', maxWidth: "none"}}></Image></span></div></div>

<p><br /> </p>

### Filing

<p><br /> </p>

A common method for deburring is a file.

<p><br /> </p>

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}><div style={{overflow: 'hidden', display: 'inline-block', margin: '0.00px 0.00px'}}><span style={{overflow: 'hidden', display: 'inline-block', margin: '0.00px 0.00px', border: '0.00px solid #000000', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)',  width: '564.50px', height: '391.71px'}}><Image autoLoad={"true"} img={require("/static/media/mechanical/cutting/image_15.jpg")} style={{ width: '564.50px', height: '1002.35px', marginLeft: '0.00px', marginTop: '0.00px', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)', maxWidth: "none"}}></Image></span></div></div>

<p><br /> </p>

When deburring an edge&nbsp;push the file away from you and across the part in a single long motion.

<p><br /> </p>

If filing down a surface, place the part in a vise, keep the file level and apply equal pressure on both sides of the file using two hands.

<p><br /> <br /> <br /> </p>

Filling all parts is generally good. A corner that will be exposed when assembled must must be filed, as the corners can catch on clothing and are generally sharper.

<p><br /> </p>

A file can also be used to shorten a part if it was made too long. 

<p><br /> </p>

The file should routinely be cleaned with a file card or chip brush (paint brush).

<p><br /> </p>

### Belt Sander

<p><br /> </p>

:::danger

We had a warning earlier about not using gloves but we want to reinforce this. NEVER WEAR GLOVES WHILE SANDING. The glove becomes an extension of your hand which has no feeling and allows the machine to pull your hand into the machine significantly easier.

:::

<p><br /> </p>

Belt Sanders come in many different flavors, belts can be anywhere from 1&rdquo; to really wide. They can also have disks but that will rarely see use if at all.

<p><br /> </p>

Typically belt sanders will have a table, this should be used whenever sandering. Some tables can be angled but generally it is easier to angle a part against the flat table if you do not care about the angle. When the sander is turned on the belt will run from the top to the bottom, this will suck the part down, so make sure to hold the part firmly so it is not flung.

<p><br /> </p>

There are three common operations that will be performed on the belt sander: deburring, flattening an edge and removing a tiny bit of length from a part.

<p><br /> </p>

For deburring edges, use a 30 degree angle and move the part from side to side to remove the burrs. This should happen very quickly. Be careful, some tables may have a decent gap between the table and belt which your part could be shot through. If this is the case, use a metal file instead.

<p><br /> </p>

When flattening a face keep the part flat against the table and if you have room to continuously have the part touch the belt then move the part from side to side. Make sure that the part is flat on the table and perpendicular to the belt.

<p><br /> </p>

Finally removing material will work just like flattening with more time against sander. The part may begin to heat up during this operation, vise grips are a safe way to hold most parts. Make sure to measure often so that you do not over do the sanding.
