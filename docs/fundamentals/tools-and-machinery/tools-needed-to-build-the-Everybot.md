# Introductory Tools and Machines for FRC/Everybot

:::danger
**This is not the current season's Everybot tool list**, this is meant to assist teams who are looking to acquire items before this season's Everybot tool list is released or prepare for next year.
:::

<br />

With this section we hope to give you some suggestions for tools when starting off, most of these suggestions coming from FIRST's Tool Recommendations.

<br />

As some general advice for starting off, here is a clip from Adam Savage on early tool purchases:

<h2> [Tool Recommendations for FIRST Robotics Competition Teams](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/frc/team-resources/frc_tool_recommendations.pdf) </h2>

The link above is the best place to start. This resource was made by Team 3847, Spectrum in combination with guidance from FIRST. This list was not made with the Everybot specifically in mind, so here are some additions, possible subtractions and clarifications.

### Must Haves For Everybot Teams

- Digital Calipers: For precision measurement and marking.

        - Digital Calipers: When the Everybot is released or shortly after there will be Engineering drawings that will provide information to manufacture the various parts of the robot. Digital calipers are the best measurement tool for finding and scribing the location of the desired features in the Engineering drawings (typically holes).

### Tools To Consider Skipping

- 3D printer: Historically the Everybot has never required a 3D printer.

- Anderson Crimping Tool: The Everybot will not require the use of an Anderson Crimping Tool.

        - 3D printer: If your only goal this season is to build the Everybot, then a printer is not needed. Additionally if nobody on the team has experience using one it can be tough to gain experience during the season. That being said, it is an amazing purchase for students who wish to get experience using them and excellent for making improvements to the Everybot/designing and building your own robot.
        - Anderson Crimping Tool: Anderson connectors are amazing for making strong wire to wire connections but the Everybot has moved away from using them. Instead we use inline WAGOs which are significantly easier to use while still providing a great connection.

### Clarification For Specific Items

- Corded Drill: An additional drill is very useful, cordless drills are very convenient if you can afford them.

- Drill bits: Good sizes to have multiples of: #7, 5/32", and 1/4".

- Hex Key Set: Multiple 1/8" and 5/32" hex keys are handy. [McMaster Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/products/hex-keys/l-keys-9/) is a good place to buy them.

- Combination Wrench Set: Ratcheting is a very useful feature if buying additional 3/8" or 7/16" wrenches. [This](https://www.andymark.com/products/3-8-in-and-7-16-in-double-box-ratcheting-socketing-wrench?via=Z2lkOi8vYW5keW1hcmsvV29ya2FyZWE6OkNhdGFsb2c6OkNhdGVnb3J5LzVhZjhhYmMyYmM2ZjZkNWUzNmYyMzM5Zg) is an amazing option but make sure to have a standard version as its smaller size may be important.
  
- Chop Saw: Purchase one with a toothed blade that is able to cut metal, do not get an abrasive cutoff wheel.

        - Corded Drill: Typically the Everybot requires many holes to be drilled, having two drills is a great upgrade. Additionally cordless drills are always nice to have if you can afford them. You will also need additional drill bits. 
        - Hex Key Set: Everybots typically use 1/8", 5/32" and 3/16" more commonly than other sizes, having two or more 1/8" and 5/32" hex keys will be useful. Some components may require the usage of a metric set. Other components may require odd sizes. Sometimes you can get away with adding tape to the end of a slightly undersized hex key. Folding hex key sets are generally not recommended.

        <Admonition type="tip" icon="ðŸ’¡" title="Additional Info">
        - 1/8" hex key = #10 button head bolts
        - 5/32" hex key = #10 socket head and 1/4"-20 button head bolts 
        - 3/16" hex key = 1/4"-20 socket head 
        - 3/8" wrench = #10 nut
  
        #10 (0.19") hardware is incredibly common in FRC and 1/4"-20 is also popular.

### Additional Tools That May Be Needed

- Tap and Die Set: Some Everybots have required the use of a 10-32 tap to add bolts and washers to hex shaft. Some Everybots have used 1/4" threaded rod, which after cutting may need to be rethreaded with a 1/4"-20 die to fasten nuts to.

- Arbor Press: Many gearboxes require you to press a pinion onto the shaft of a motor and an Arbor Press is the best tool for that job. There are ways to press pinions without an Arbor Press but using alternate methods increases the likelihood that a mistake will be made.
