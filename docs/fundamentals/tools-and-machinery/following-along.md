# Following Along

The remaining sections will describe how to measure, mark, cut, drill and tap. Reading about these skills before building your robot will help but we highly recommend practicing them before constructing your robot if you have time.

<br/>
If following along the goal is to finish with the following part:
<br/>

<div style={{ textAlign: 'center'}}><div style={{overflow: 'hidden', display: 'inline-block', margin: '0.00px 0.00px'}}><span style={{overflow: 'hidden', display: 'inline-block', margin: '0.00px 0.00px', border: '0.00px solid #000000', transform: 'rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px)',  width: '624.00px'}}><Image autoLoad={"true"} img={require("/static/media/mechanical/following-along/image_0.png")} ></Image></span></div></div>

<br/>

This part will give your team experience reading machine drawings, measuring/marking for cuts, using cutting tools, marking hole locations, drilling and optionally tapping.

<br/> 

Additionally if you are new to FRC or the Everybot we hope this exercise will encourage you to start the tool purchasing process before or early into the season.

## Materials needed

You will need the following materials:
<br/>
- Aluminum stock with a 2" width
- Qty(4) X 10-32" bolts (3/8" - 1/2")
- A [CIM](https://www.andymark.com/products/2-5-in-cim-motor) or [NEO](https://www.revrobotics.com/rev-21-1650/) motor (A CIM should come in the kit of parts)

Aluminum tube stock can be used for this however it should probably be reserved for the robot, instead bar stock can be used. Home Depot has [aluminum bar stock](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-2-in-x-36-in-Aluminum-Flat-Bar-with-1-8-in-Thick-801977/204273999) for ~$14 and 10-32 bolts in [3/8"](https://www.homedepot.com/p/10-32-x-3-8-in-Combo-Round-Head-Stainless-Steel-Machine-Screw-4-Pack-816261/204282591) or [1/2"](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Everbilt-10-32-x-1-2-in-Combo-Round-Head-Stainless-Steel-Machine-Screw-4-Pack-814391/204274805) for ~$1.50. 

<br/>
The bar stock can be used to train many students, up to 8 students per bar if match drilling. We suggest not using home depot 10-32 bolts on your robot, for better 10-32 bolts see [Bolt Depot](https://www.boltdepot.com/Socket_button_head_Stainless_steel_18-8_10-32.aspx).

## Tools Needed

### General

- Vise
- Clamps
- Safety Equipment

### Measurement And Marking

- Tape Measure
- Digital Calipers
- Speed Square
- Marker (sharpie)
- Center Punch

### Cutting By Hand And With Machines

- One of the following (preferably at least one machine + a hacksaw):

  - Chop Saw with toothed cutting blade made for metal
  - Vertical Bandsaw or Tabletop Jigsaw (with blade for cutting metal)
  - Horizontal Bandsaw
  - Hacksaw
- Metal File
- Optionally a Belt Sander

:::tip
If you can only buy one cutting machine, we would recommend either a chop saw or vertical bandsaw. Generally we would prefer a chop saw however they are spookier, with some teams preferring students not to use them.
<br/>
The horizontal bandsaw should probably not be your first machine purchase as it is less versatile however it is safer than the other two machines.
<br/>
We highly recommend having a hacksaw no matter your setup, sometimes you just need a hacksaw ðŸ™‚
:::

### Drilling
- Drill
- #7 Drill Bit
- Step Drill Bit capable of 1 - 1/8"
- Drill Press (highly recommended)
- [Cutting fluid](https://www.acehardware.com/departments/plumbing/plumbing-tools/cutting-fluids/2410348) (highly recommended)

### Tapping (Optional)
- 10-32 Tap
- Tap Handle or Tap Wrench
- Cutting Fluid
- Electrical Tape
- 5/32" Drill Bit (or #21)

:::note
Tapping has been used on some Everybots but not all, there is a chance that the Everybot will require a different tap size or no tapping.
