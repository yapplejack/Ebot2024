TODO: Verify if we are using Onshape and improve section

<br/>

For teams who are brand new to CAD and want to know how to navigate it: 

<br/>

Follow the steps here to create your Onshape educational account: [Onshape4FRC](https://onshape4frc.com/getting-started). (This is not needed to view the CAD TODO: verify \<\-)

<br/>

After creating your educational account you may want to look at this [article](https://learn.onshape.com/learn/article/navigating-onshape-for-new-users). See View Manipulation & Display Styles to navigate the documents. Also see the measure section for taking measurements from the robot. (There might be something better than this, I just want people to know how to navigate and measure.)

If you want to learn more about Onshape to make changes to the Everybot or CAD your own robot please see the linked training in Onshape4FRC.
