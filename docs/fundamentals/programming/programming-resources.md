# Programming Resources

<h2>[WPILib documentation website](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/introduction.html)</h2>

This a great place to start your FRC coding journey no matter your skill level. It is "the official documentation home for the FIRSTÂ® Robotics Competition Control System and WPILib software packages". Their Zero To Robot section will get you a driving robot without knowledge of programming. Beyond that there are hardware and software component overviews, programming basics, advanced programming, example projects and so much more.

Another incredibly important resource from WPILib is their source code for [Java](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/tree/main/wpilibj/src/main/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj) and [C++](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/tree/main/wpilibc/src/main/native/cpp) or their more concise documentation for [Java](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/java/) and [C++](https://github.wpilib.org/allwpilib/docs/release/cpp/). This is incredibly useful for understanding what specific pieces of code do, for instance here is the source code for the [differential drive class](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/blob/main/wpilibj/src/main/java/edu/wpi/first/wpilibj/drive/DifferentialDrive.java) which can be used to drive your robot.

This is the first link in WPILib's Zero To Robot section but we wanted to echo this as a great resource.
